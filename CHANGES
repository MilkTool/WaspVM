2008/08/04 UNIX I/O System Refactor
  - Fixed error in queue free method.
  - Refactored OS loop so libevent and windows loop can be interchanged.
  - Removed raw-input, raw-output and channel types as they are unused.
  - Modifies OS connections with three-phase logic: connected, closing,
    closed.
  - Corrected a lot of missed traces in os-* types.
  - Ensured os-connections can be supplied to connection primitives.
  - Removed mention of sys/filesystem and sys/regex from modules.
  - Removed multiple processes waiting on a single channel; confuses os 
    handling.
  - Removed resolve-ipv4 primitive.
  - Modified tcp-connect to require a string for host name and either a string
    or an integer for the service, treating the following as equivalent:
      (tcp-connect "localhost" "http")
      (tcp-connect "127.0.0.1" "80")
      (tcp-connect "kabuki.merseine.nu" 80)
  - Backported Console I/O to Windows environment.

2008/08/03 Process System Cleanup and Improvement
  - Added set-current-input! primitive.
  - Added set-current-output! primitive.
  - Added set-process-input! primitive.
  - Added set-process-output! primitive.
  - Added process-input primitive.
  - Added process-output primitive.
  - Renamed active-process to current-process.
  - Restored lib/tcp-server from Mosquito.
  - Modified lib/tcp-server to pass ancilliary arguments, much like spawn.
  - Restored lib/http-server from Mosquito.
  - Restored lib/http-file-server from Mosquito.
  - Modified dir-files to work under Windows.

2008/08/01 Timeout System Improvements
  - Generalized timeouts to tasks
  - Modified timeout primitive to create a task with the timeout method.
  - Modified pause primitive to accept an optional timeout in milliseconds.
  - Backported to WIN32, Isolating LibEvent Calls
  - Note, moved all subsystems back into the core vm; need to explore better
    ways to export symbols to DLLs than using the all-in-one-dll method.
  - WaspC works, Wasp doesn't, as expected.
  - BUG: (pause 100) at REPL causes halt.
  - Restored lib/url from Mosquito.
  - Restored lib/http-url from Mosquito.

2008/07/28 LibEvent Restoration
  - Restored event loop from future.
  - Modified core/io module to handle os-connection outputs and inputs.
  - Added os-service type to vm, derived from input, yields os-connections.
  - Added (tcp-serve portno) -> os-service to vm/os.c
  - Corrected optional arguments to be type-specific and refuse subtypes.
  - Added macros for requiring subtype'd arguments.
  - Implemented timeout scheduling.
  - Made makefile default to -DNDEBUG.
  - Added timeout multimethod to core/io to overlay the primitive.
  - Added timeout option to wait multimethod.
  - Fixed (input process) and (output process) methods in core/io.
  - Aliased <number> to <integer>, since eventually integers will be a 
    subset of <number>.
  - Added timeout argument to wait multimethod.

2008/06/24 WaspDoc Integration
  - Added exprs->string primitive.
  - Added write-lisp-file to core/file module.
  - Added string-read-expr! primitive to vm/core.c and vm/string.c
  - Modified string-skip-space! to return number of spaces skipped.
  - Fixed a bug in the parser that considered a single dot to be an incomplete 
    expression; should be an error.
  - Reintegrated WaspDoc from pre-Rewind tree.

2008/06/20 Namespace Cleanup
  - Renamed set primitive to make-set.
  - Renamed dict primitive to make-dict.
  - Renamed tc-append! primitive to tc-add!
  - Renamed tc-splice! primitive to tc-append!
  - Modified tc-add! to accept multiple items, not just one.
  - Modified tc-remove! to accept multiple items, not just one.
  - Modified iter in lib/iterate to generate tc iterators.
  - tc no longer considered a list by list predicate.
  - tc no longer considered a pair by pair predicate.
  - tc no longer a subtype of pair.

2008/06/11 WaspDoc Parses Module Files
  - Added waspdoc/waspdoc.ms
  - waspdoc/waspdoc can analyze module files for their imports and exports
    !! Note, this does not identify a module's macro exports, nor does it expand those macros. 

2008/06/10 Subsystems Back From The Future
  - Added subsystem compilation back into the build system.
  - Restored regex subsystem into the build system.
  - Restored subsystem installation in the install script.
  - Added filesystem subsystem.
  - Moved all filesystem primitives other than file open and read primitives to filesystem 
    subsystem.
  - Removed uses of file-path? from core.
  - Added dependency on sys/filesystem to compiler.

2008/06/10 Initial Import from WaspVM 0.3
  This is a fork of WaspVM 0.3 devel as of 2008/06/05 with reduced build complexity and the
  removal of some functionality not needed for installation or compilation.  It is the new
  development focus of the Wasp project -- see the README for details.

  - WaspVM compiles on Linux 2.6 with GNU toolchain.
  - Removed timeouts, async I/O, crc32 
  - WaspC runs identically under Rewind VM.
  - Wasp REPL runs under Rewind VM.
  - Ported over all dependencies of WaspC and REPL to Rewind.
  - Ported install script back into build system.
