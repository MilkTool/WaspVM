2008/12/26 Terminal Support Improvements
  - Bumped version to 0.4.2.
  - Moved lib/env to use a dictionary instead of an assoc-list.
  - Ensured environ is not used on Windows.
  - Added conio-size primitive, which returns the current number of rows and
    columns.
  - Added tty-size primitive, which returns the current number of rows and
    columns.
    + NOTE: Only works on Linux.. Need to figure this out for BSD.
  - Added scud-size function, which returns the current number of rows and
    columns as a list.
  - Added clear background to vt100, simply resets background; workaround for
    transparent terminals that are only transparent when there is no
    background color.
  - Added clear background to conio, simply uses black.

2008/12/26 The SCUD Terminal Library
  - Added unbuffer-console primitive, which prevents line buffering of stdin.
  - Added conio-goto, conio-set-attr, conio-cls, conio-clear for Win32.
  - Introduced the SCUD terminal abstraction library.
  - Added the osdef macro to lib/env, which permits per-OS function 
    definitions.
  - Tagged 0.4.1

2008/9/18 Code Quality Improvements for MOSREF 
  - Fixed bug in lib/build when building cross-platform applications for win32
  - Added (preload module ..) function to core/import; informs the module
    loader that the specified module should be considered "loaded in the
    near future."
  - Added logic to lib/build to manage circular dependencies in standalone
    applications by emitting a preload after the core modules are loaded but 
    before the remainder.
  - Removed some superfluous debug spam.
  - Tagged WASPVM as 0.4.
  - Added Henry Spencer's regex for WIN32 platform, which is regex-poor.
  - Added string->uppercase, string->lowercase primitives to core.c
  
2008/08/30 MOSREF Proxy Command and Fixes
  At this point, MOSREF is functional, but could use some improvements; this
  milestone is focussed on making MOSREF a production-worthy tool.
  
  - Verified operation of drone bridging.
  - Moved mosref/patch to lib/patch.
  - Removed debugging spam from lib/patch.
  - Modified MOSREF communications to operate in blocks of random sizes from 0 
    to 255 bytes, each block has a checksum, the overall message has a 
    checksum.  This reduces the potential for noise to tie up memory or hang 
    the node.  (It will still cause the connection to break, though.)
  - Renamed tcp-connect primitive to start-tcp-connect
  - Modified outbound tcp connections to yield 'connect after they first 
    connect.
  - Added tcp-connect function to core/io; emulates old synchronous 
    tcp-connect behavior.  (Eating the opening 'connect message.)
  - Restored tcp-forward.
  - Adulterated spawn in mosref to traceback and halt on an unhandled error in
    any spawned process.
  - Ensured that OS connections will only yield a 'close once; subsequent 
    waits on the connection result in an infinite wait.  (Which corresponds
    with other inputs.)
  - Restored the MOSREF "proxy" command.

    a 32 byte random string.
  - Added (curve25519-secret public private) -> secret; using a pair of remote 
    public key and local private key, determines a 32 byte shared secret.  This

2008/08/08 Tweaks to WaspDoc Check Source
  - Modified waspdoc check source to use dir-files to identify source files.
  - Modified waspdoc check source to add "UNDOCUMENTED" to undocumented source files.

2008/08/07 I/O System Bugfixes

    (exit) was called.
  - Removed (exit) calls from bin/install and bin/waspc applications that were 
    concealing this problem.

  - Removed mention of sys/filesystem and sys/regex from modules.
  - Removed multiple processes waiting on a single channel; confuses os 
    handling.

    or an integer for the service, treating the following as equivalent:
      (tcp-connect "localhost" "http")

      (tcp-connect "kabuki.merseine.nu" 80)

  - WaspC works, Wasp doesn't, as expected.
  - BUG: (pause 100) at REPL causes halt.
  - Restored lib/url from Mosquito.

2008/06/11 WaspDoc Parses Module Files
  - Added waspdoc/waspdoc.ms
  - waspdoc/waspdoc can analyze module files for their imports and exports

  This is a fork of WaspVM 0.3 devel as of 2008/06/05 with reduced build complexity and the
  removal of some functionality not needed for installation or compilation.  It is the new
  development focus of the Wasp project -- see the README for details.

  - WaspVM compiles on Linux 2.6 with GNU toolchain.
  - Removed timeouts, async I/O, crc32 
  - WaspC runs identically under Rewind VM.
  - Wasp REPL runs under Rewind VM.
  - Ported over all dependencies of WaspC and REPL to Rewind.
